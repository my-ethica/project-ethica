# Project description: 
Ethica is a digital exchange platform that utilises Blockchain technology to connect ethical investors with Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives around the globe. We provide our investors with access to the right social impact projects that align with their personal values and hold up to our own high ethical standards – making it simple to invest in the initiatives, projects and programs that matter most to our users. 

Using Blockchain technology, we can provide full transparency to investors on where their money is going, and how it is being utilised – because at Ethica, the returns are so much more than monetary.

Our aim is to make the benefits of Blockchain technology more accessible to the 96% of the world’s population that is yet to, or unable to experience it. Financial inclusivity is an active goal we are working towards. We are working to bring the global community together through the Blockchain to create an impact where it is needed most – at ground level. We envision a reliable marketplace where underserved communities have access to vital products and services at fair prices with low margins, made possible through low-cost Blockchain technology.

The UN estimates that the total investment needs of reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) are between USD 5 trillion and 7 trillion per year. Developing countries alone require USD 3.9 trillion in investment annually (International Monetary Fund, 2018) and are estimated to have an investment gap of about USD 2.5 trillion (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], 2014). Considering the scale of investments needed, it is imperative that private capital and not just governments play a significant role in funding these initiatives.
Together, with the power of more socially responsible investment opportunities, we can build a more sustainable future for our world.

# Basic information:
Ethica was founded to address 3 critical issues:
1.	To create a simple and accessible digital platform for retail investors to access high quality projects and opportunities that are based on ethical and sustainable principles.
2.	To be a recognized global platform for impact entrepreneurs and start-ups looking to launch and raise funds for projects which meet UN SDG and ESG narratives.
3.	To create an ecosystem that directly delivers millions of digital wallets with free token drops to underserved communities worldwide while also providing requisite education on blockchain technology to bridge the inequality and wealth gap

Ethica aims to address these issues by adopting digital blockchain technology. Traditionally, retail investors have limited opportunities to participate in and support ethical and sustainable projects due to them being typically large sized and in later stages of the project life cycle. We want to disrupt this model by creating a platform where the common man can invest and support causes, he or she believes in, from day one. By tokenizing these opportunities, individual investors can now contribute smaller quantum amounts towards these initiatives.

As part of the Ethica’s vision and leadership, Ethica pledges to donate 80% of profits back to the ecosystem to sustain the wallet outreach and giving program to support and enhance the value of the token and hence distributing more wallets and value to the community.
